Regions TDD
===========

Background
----------

While working on this project, I had an idea to recurse in regions within a region instaed of recursing by each cell (if this is not clear, continue on and come back to this later). I was about to implement cells (as class engine::Cell), but I realized that there is a significant and fundamental difference between the two concepts. Hence, I need to delve into the design requirements in detail and see which classes emerge.

*todo*
